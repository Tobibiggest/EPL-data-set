# EPL data set
 Project description The Premier League was founded on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky.  In total, 50 clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven teams overall have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (6), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).  Does the home stadium ground give any advantage? And if the answer is yes, whatâ€™s the quantity for this advantage? What is the best way to collect points, defensive or attacking play? Who is the best club manager in PL history?
